# Technology Pivot: From Bootstrap to React

## 1. Update the Project Backlog
- **New Epics and Stories**:
    - Create an epic titled `Technology Pivot: Bootstrap to React` with related user stories:
        - _"As a developer, I need to set up the React project to ensure it aligns with existing project requirements."_
        - _"As a designer, I need to ensure the React implementation supports the existing Material Design look and feel."_
        - _"As a team, we need to migrate key UI components from Bootstrap to React to maintain functionality and visual consistency."_
- **Technical Debt**: Identify and document any Bootstrap-specific dependencies that need removal or cleanup.

## 2. Add to the Sprint Planning Process
- Allocate tasks for researching, implementing, and testing the new React stack.
- Ensure the workload remains balanced to maintain project momentum.

---

## 3. Record Decisions in a Decision Log
- **Reason for Pivot**:
    - Scalability concerns with Bootstrap.
    - Improved performance and maintainability with React.
    - Alignment with the team's long-term technical strategy.
- **Stakeholder Agreement**: Note who approved the pivot and any conditions (e.g., deadlines, budget constraints).

---

## 4. Update Project Documentation
- **ReadMe**: Update the ReadMe file to reflect the React stack and setup instructions.
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Revise diagrams to incorporate React.
- **Design System**: Update style guidelines to reference React components instead of Bootstrap classes.

## 5. Retrospective Notes
- Capture lessons learned during sprints where the transition occurs.
- Reflect on how the pivot impacted velocity, team morale, and deliverables.

---

## 6. Communicate with Stakeholders
- Share a one-page summary outlining:
    - Current state of the project.
    - How React aligns better with project goals.
    - Milestones for completing the transition.

---

## 7. Track Progress
- Use a Kanban board or sprint tracking tool to visualize tasks.
- Define and monitor milestones:
    - React environment setup.
    - Migration of key components.
    - Full transition completion.

---

## 8. Maintain Agility
- Regularly review and adapt the pivot strategy in stand-ups and sprint reviews.
- Encourage team feedback to address challenges and refine the process.
