With your project set up for Docker, here’s how you can build and run it using Docker commands based on the provided docker-compose.yml file and Dockerfile.

Steps to Build and Run the Project

	1.	Build the Docker Containers:
To build the containers as specified in your docker-compose.yml file, navigate to the directory containing docker-compose.yml and run:

docker-compose build

This will build the app service defined in the Dockerfile.

	2.	Run the Docker Containers:
Once the build is complete, start the containers with:

docker-compose up

This command starts both the app and db services. The app service will be available on port 3001, and the MySQL database (db) will be accessible on port 3306.

	3.	Verify the Setup:
	•	For the Node.js App: Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3001 to access your app.
	•	For MySQL: You can connect to the MySQL database at localhost:3306 using the credentials specified (DB_USER=root and DB_PASSWORD=9Xl3Tg4Qz5Bv7Wn2Pk8R).
	4.	Optional: Run in Detached Mode:
To run the containers in the background (detached mode), add the -d flag:

docker-compose up -d


	5.	Stopping the Containers:
When you’re done, stop the running containers with:

docker-compose down



This setup should launch both your Node.js application and the MySQL database within Docker, allowing you to develop and test in a containerized environment.
